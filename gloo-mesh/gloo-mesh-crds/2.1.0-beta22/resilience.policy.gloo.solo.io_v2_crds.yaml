              FailoverPolicy is used to enable failover routing for traffic being sent to selected destinations.
              When traffic is being routed to a backing service within a selected virtual destination, if that backing service is detected as being in an unhealthy state, traffic will be re-routed to another healthy backing service by locality as specified in the FailoverPolicy config.
              FailoverPolicy can be used to reroute traffic across clusters when the local instance of a destination service fails. This requires that the backing destinations of the selected virtual destination belong to meshes in the same TrustDomain.
              FailoverPolicies are applied at the *Destination* level.

              Note: If an OutlierDetectionPolicy is not configured for the same destinations,
              we will apply our default.

              FaultInjectionPolicy is used to inject faults (latency and errors) into requests sent through the mesh.
              Fault specification is part of a VirtualService rule. Faults include
              aborting the Http request from downstream service, and/or delaying
              proxying of requests. A fault rule MUST HAVE delay or abort or both.
              FaultInjectionPolicies are applied at the *Route* level.
