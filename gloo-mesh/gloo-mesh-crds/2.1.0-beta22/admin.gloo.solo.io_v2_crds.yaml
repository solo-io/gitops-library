              `Workspace` describes a logical grouping of Kubernetes namespaces within the clusters that are part of
              a virtual mesh. Workspace can be treated as a boundary for configuration and service discovery.
              The specification describes how to select namespaces or/and clusters for a given workspace.

              The workspace-wide settings such as `importFrom`, `exportTo` are configured in the `WorkspaceSettings`
              object. Refer to the `WorkspaceSettings` documentation for details.

              The following example creates the `web` workspace that selects all workload clusters and all namespaces
              within those clusters to be part of the workspace.
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: Workspace
              metadata:
                name: web
                namespace: gloo-mesh
              spec:
                workloadClusters:
                  - name: "*"
                    namespaces:
                    - name: "*"
              ```

              The following configuration creates the `web` workspace that selects the `web` namespace from all workload
              clusters that have the label of `region: us-east` to be part of the workspace. Refer to the `KubernetesCluster`
              documentation for examples on how to label your KubernetesCluster resource.
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: Workspace
              metadata:
                name: web
                namespace: gloo-mesh
              spec:
                workloadClusters:
                  - selector:
                      region: us-east
                    namespaces:
                      - name: web
              ```

              The following example creates the `policy` namespace that does NOT have any workload clusters.
              This workspace also has the `gloo.solo.io/global` label which other workspaces
              can use to import this workspace by label in their `WorkspaceSettings` resource.
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: Workspace
              metadata:
                name: policy
                namespace: gloo-mesh
                labels:
                  gloo.solo.io/global: 'true'
              ```

              The example below creates the `backend` workspace that select any namespace that starts with `ns1` in `cluster1`
              and any namespace that starts with `ns2` in `cluster2`. It has the `gloo.solo.io/exportToGateway` label,
              which other workspaces can use to import this workspace by label in their `WorkspaceSettings` resource.
              Refer to the `KubernetesCluster` documentation for examples on how to name your KubernetesCluster resource.
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: Workspace

              `WorkspaceSettings` define a set of workspace-wide parameters such as `importFrom` and `exportTo` for the workspace.
              These settings are commonly defined by the workspace admin. There are 3 key configurations related to `WorkspaceSettings`:

              - importFrom: To import resources from another workspace to your workspace, configure the
              `importFrom` field in the `WorkspaceSettings` resource for your workspace.

              - exportTo: To export resources in your workspace to other workspaces, configure the `exportTo`
              field in the `WorkspaceSettings` resource for your workspace.

              - options: Configure service isolation, federation and other options for the workspace.

              You can specify your workspace's `importFrom` or `exportTo` or other workspace configuration options in your
              `WorkspaceSettings` resource for your workspace. Only one `WorkspaceSettings` resource can be defined for
              each workspace. The resource can be deployed to any of your workspace's namespaces in your workload cluster(s).

              Export:
              Only the resources below can be exported to other workspaces:
              - Kubernetes Service
              - VirtualDestination
              - ExternalService
              - RouteTable

              You can use the `exportTo` field in the `WorkspaceSettings` resource for the workspace to configure what resources
              are exported to which other workspaces. For example, the `web` application developer can export the RouteTable resource
              from the `web` workspace to an admin-owned gateway workspace.

              The following workspace example defines the `backend` workspace. The workspace settings example
              exports the `backend` workspace to any workspaces that matches the label `team: web`.
              In addition, all exported resources from the `backend` workspace are made available
              for any workspace that has the label `team: web` to import.

              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: Workspace
              metadata:
                name: backend
                namespace: gloo-mesh
                labels:
                  team: backend
              spec:
                workloadClusters:
                  - namespaces:
                    - name: backend*
              ---
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: WorkspaceSettings
              metadata:
                name: default
                namespace: backend-namespace
              spec:
                exportTo:
                  - workspaces:
                    - selector:
                        team: web
              ```

              Import:
              To import exported resources from other workspaces, configure the `importFrom` field in
              the `WorkspaceSettings` resource for your workspace.

              For example, by importing the `web` workspace, the admin-owned gateway workspace can delegate routing for a subset
              of the gateway traffic to a RouteTable resource in the `web` workspace.

              The following workspace defines the `web` workspace. The workspace settings example imports
              the exported resources from the `backend` workspace into the `web` workspace. The exported resources from the
              `backend` workspace is available to the `web` workspace for imports because the `web` workspace
              has the `team:web` label.
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: Workspace
              metadata:
                name: web
                namespace: gloo-mesh
                labels:
                  team: web
              spec:
                workloadClusters:
                  - namespaces:
                    - name: web*
              ---
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: WorkspaceSettings
              metadata:
                name: default
                namespace: web-namespace
              spec:
                importFrom:
                  - workspaces:
                    - name: backend
              ```

              The following example imports any workspaces that are available for the `web` workspace to import and
              has the `team: backend` label into the `web` workspace. After this is deployed
              in the `web-namepsace` namespace of a given workload cluster that are part of the workspace,
              all exported resources from the `backend` workspaces which has the label `team: backend`
              are imported into the `web` workspace and available for use by anything in the `web` workspace.
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: WorkspaceSettings
              metadata:
                name: default
                namespace: web-namepsace
              spec:
                importFrom:
                  - workspaces:
                    - selector:
                        team: backend
              ```

              WorkspaceSettings defined in the admin namespace for Gloo Mesh will override settings defined in individual workspaces. Must have the name "global" to be picked up by Gloo Mesh.

                  A workspace can specify resources to export for use by other workspaces.
                  Currently the following types of objects can be exported across workspaces:
                  - kubernetes services
                  - virtual destinations
                  - external destinations
                  - route tables
                  You can select workspace using labels, for example:
                  ```yaml
                      exportTo:
                        - workspaces:
                          - selector:
                              team: backend
                  ```
                  Or select workspace name using exact name match, for example:
                  ```yaml
                      exportTo:
                        - workspaces:
                          - name: backend
                  ```
                  Or exportTo all other workspaces, for example:
                  ```yaml
                      exportTo:
                        - workspaces:
                          - name: *
                  ```
                  Or select workspace using labels and name using simple regex, for example:
                  ```yaml
                      exportTo:
                        - workspaces:
                          - selector:
                              team: backend
                              name: backend*
                  ```
                  Or select workspace name using labels or select name using simple regex, for example:
                  ```yaml
                      exportTo:
                        - workspaces:

                  Objects must both be exported by the workspace that is being imported and imported into this workspace in order to be shared across workspaces.
                  Imported objects allow the creation of routes and outbound-communication from one workspace to another.
                  Currently the following types of objects can be imported across workspaces:
                  - kubernetes services
                  - virtual destinations
                  - external destinations

                  ```
                  Or select workspace name using exact name match, for example:
                  ```yaml

                          The default mode is to use sni routing via tls passthrough at the East/West Gateway to route to services across clusters.
                          In the future, this may change to become smarter (e.g., detect if any pods backing the virtual destination don't have sidecars,
                          if so, then use tls termination so all pods are routeable).

                          This mode is ideal for Gloo Mesh Gateway, i.e. some backing pods don't have sidecars.
                          Since TLS is terminated at the East/West Gateway, the backing service (if it has a sidecar) will not be able to
                          verify the istio mTLS identity of the originating client; rather it will verify the istio mTLS cert of the East/West Gateway.
