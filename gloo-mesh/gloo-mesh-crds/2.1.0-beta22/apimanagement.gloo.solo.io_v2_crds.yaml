                                      The [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) filter which is used to provide a value.
                                      variables defined in `variables` can be used in the jq filter via regular jq variable syntax.
                                      For example, a variable named "userIdHeader" can be used in a jq filter as `$userIdHeader`
                                      Jq filters must only result in one value, or an error will be sent back to the client.
                                      For example, for the input `[1,2,3]`, the jq filter `.[]` is not a valid jq filter as it results
                                      in multiple jq results. However, the jq filter '. | join(",")' is valid as it results in one result: "1,2,3".
                                      Refer to the [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) for jq syntax and tips.
                                      --- Using variables ---
                                      Variables that are declared in the `variables` field are available at the top level of the input JSON object to the
                                      jq filter.
                                      For example, if the following variables have been declared:
                                      ```yaml
                                      variables:
                                        userIdHeader:
                                          request_header: x-user-id
                                        resolverResultVar:
                                          resolver_result: {}
                                      ```
                                      then the input object to the `jq` filter would be
                                      ```json
                                      {
                                       "userIdHeader": <x-user-id header value from GraphQL request>,
                                       "resolverResultVar": { .. the resolver result .. }
                                      }
                                      ```
                                      --- Using a jq filter ---
                                      Given the following input object to the `jq` transformation, we can use a filter to transform the values.
                                      ```json
                                      {
                                       "userIdHeader": "john_doe123",
                                       "resolverResultVar": { "data": {"name": "John Doe"} }
                                      }
                                      ```
                                      If the `jq` filter is defined as
                                      ```
                                      "User: " + .userIdHeader + ", Name: " + .resolverResultVar.data.name
                                      ```
                                      the result of the jq transformation would be
                                      ```
                                      "User john_doe123, Name: John Doe"
                                      ```

                        Type merge configuration for this subschema. Let's say this subschema is a Users service schema
                             and provides the User type (with a query to fetch a user given the username)
                             ```gql
                             type Query {
                               GetUser(username: String): User
                             }
                             type User {
                               username: String
                               firstName: String
                               lastName: String
                             }
                             ```
                             and another subschema, e.g. Reviews schema, may have a partial User type:
                             ```gql
                             type Review {
                               author: User
                             }
                             type User {
                               username: String
                             }
                             ```
                             We want to provide the relevant information from this Users service schema,
                             so that another API that can give us a partial User type (with the username) will then
                             be able to have access to the full user type. With the correct type merging config under the Users subschema, e.g.:
                             ```yaml
                             type_merge:
                               User:
                                 selection_set: '{ username }'
                                 query_name: 'GetUser'
                                 args:
                                   username: username
                             ```
                             the stitched schema will now be able to provide the full user type to all types that require it. In this case,
                             we can now get the first name of an author from the Review.author field even though the Reviews schema doesn't
                             provide the full User type.

              The GraphQLResolverMap Resource contains a mapping from types to fields to
              resolutions. For example, for a schema with type `Query` and field `GetName`

                                        The [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) filter which is used to provide a value.
                                        variables defined in `variables` can be used in the jq filter via regular jq variable syntax.
                                        For example, a variable named "userIdHeader" can be used in a jq filter as `$userIdHeader`
                                        Jq filters must only result in one value, or an error will be sent back to the client.
                                        For example, for the input `[1,2,3]`, the jq filter `.[]` is not a valid jq filter as it results
                                        in multiple jq results. However, the jq filter '. | join(",")' is valid as it results in one result: "1,2,3".
                                        Refer to the [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) for jq syntax and tips.
                                        --- Using variables ---
                                        Variables that are declared in the `variables` field are available at the top level of the input JSON object to the
                                        jq filter.
                                        For example, if the following variables have been declared:
                                        ```yaml
                                        variables:
                                          userIdHeader:
                                            request_header: x-user-id
                                          resolverResultVar:
                                            resolver_result: {}
                                        ```
                                        then the input object to the `jq` filter would be
                                        ```json
                                        {
                                         "userIdHeader": <x-user-id header value from GraphQL request>,
                                         "resolverResultVar": { .. the resolver result .. }
                                        }
                                        ```
                                        --- Using a jq filter ---
                                        Given the following input object to the `jq` transformation, we can use a filter to transform the values.
                                        ```json
                                        {
                                         "userIdHeader": "john_doe123",
                                         "resolverResultVar": { "data": {"name": "John Doe"} }
                                        }
                                        ```
                                        If the `jq` filter is defined as
                                        ```
                                        "User: " + .userIdHeader + ", Name: " + .resolverResultVar.data.name
                                        ```
                                        the result of the jq transformation would be
                                        ```
                                        "User john_doe123, Name: John Doe"
                                        ```

                                                The [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) filter which is used to provide a value.
                                                variables defined in `variables` can be used in the jq filter via regular jq variable syntax.
                                                For example, a variable named "userIdHeader" can be used in a jq filter as `$userIdHeader`
                                                Jq filters must only result in one value, or an error will be sent back to the client.
                                                For example, for the input `[1,2,3]`, the jq filter `.[]` is not a valid jq filter as it results
                                                in multiple jq results. However, the jq filter '. | join(",")' is valid as it results in one result: "1,2,3".
                                                Refer to the [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) for jq syntax and tips.
                                                --- Using variables ---
                                                Variables that are declared in the `variables` field are available at the top level of the input JSON object to the
                                                jq filter.
                                                For example, if the following variables have been declared:
                                                ```yaml
                                                variables:
                                                  userIdHeader:
                                                    request_header: x-user-id
                                                  resolverResultVar:
                                                    resolver_result: {}
                                                ```
                                                then the input object to the `jq` filter would be
                                                ```json
                                                {
                                                 "userIdHeader": <x-user-id header value from GraphQL request>,
                                                 "resolverResultVar": { .. the resolver result .. }
                                                }
                                                ```
                                                --- Using a jq filter ---
                                                Given the following input object to the `jq` transformation, we can use a filter to transform the values.
                                                ```json
                                                {
                                                 "userIdHeader": "john_doe123",
                                                 "resolverResultVar": { "data": {"name": "John Doe"} }
                                                }
                                                ```
                                                If the `jq` filter is defined as
                                                ```
                                                "User: " + .userIdHeader + ", Name: " + .resolverResultVar.data.name
                                                ```
                                                the result of the jq transformation would be
                                                ```
                                                "User john_doe123, Name: John Doe"
                                                ```

                                            variable:

                                                  The [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) filter which is used to provide a value.
                                                  variables defined in `variables` can be used in the jq filter via regular jq variable syntax.
                                                  For example, a variable named "userIdHeader" can be used in a jq filter as `$userIdHeader`
                                                  Jq filters must only result in one value, or an error will be sent back to the client.
                                                  For example, for the input `[1,2,3]`, the jq filter `.[]` is not a valid jq filter as it results
                                                  in multiple jq results. However, the jq filter '. | join(",")' is valid as it results in one result: "1,2,3".

                                                  --- Using variables ---
                                                  Variables that are declared in the `variables` field are available at the top level of the input JSON object to the
                                                  jq filter.
                                                  For example, if the following variables have been declared:
                                                  ```yaml
                                                  variables:
                                                    userIdHeader:
                                                      request_header: x-user-id
                                                    resolverResultVar:
                                                      resolver_result: {}
                                                  ```
                                                  then the input object to the `jq` filter would be
                                                  ```json
                                                  {
                                                   "userIdHeader": <x-user-id header value from GraphQL request>,
                                                   "resolverResultVar": { .. the resolver result .. }
                                                  }
                                                  ```
                                                  --- Using a jq filter ---
                                                  Given the following input object to the `jq` transformation, we can use a filter to transform the values.
                                                  ```json
                                                  {
                                                   "userIdHeader": "john_doe123",
                                                   "resolverResultVar": { "data": {"name": "John Doe"} }
                                                  }
                                                  ```
                                                  If the `jq` filter is defined as
                                                  ```
                                                  "User: " + .userIdHeader + ", Name: " + .resolverResultVar.data.name
                                                  ```
                                                  the result of the jq transformation would be
                                                  ```
                                                  "User john_doe123, Name: John Doe"
                                                  ```
                                                type: string
                                              variable:
                                                description: |-
                                                  The name of a variable declared in the `variables` field. The value of the variable
                                                  is returned with no transformation.

                                            Sets the headers on the request to the REST destination.
                                            This includes setting HTTP :path header.
                                            This is a map of HTTP Header name to a transformation which determines the Header value.
                                            The transformation must result in a string value, or an error will be sent back to the client.
                                            By default, the :method header is set to GET. If `body` is set, then the :method is POST. This can be overridden
                                            by setting the :method header manually below.
