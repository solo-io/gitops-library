              MirrorPolicy is used to mirror/shadow traffic to a another destination (traffic will be sent to its original destination in addition to the mirrored destinations).
              MirrorPolicies are applied at the *Route* level.

                                                If specified, the match result will be inverted before checking. Defaults to false.

                                                Examples:

                                                * The regex *\d{3}* does not match the value *1234*, so it will match when inverted.
                                                * The range [-10,0) will match the value -1, so it will not match when inverted.

                                                If specified, header match will be performed based on the prefix of the header value.
                                                Note: empty prefix is not allowed, please use present_match instead.

                                                Examples:

                                                * The prefix *abcd* matches the value *abcdxyz*, but not for *abcxyz*.

                                                If specified, header match will be performed based on whether the header is in the
                                                request.

                                                If specified, header match will be performed based on range.
                                                The rule will match if the request header value is within this range.
                                                The entire request header value must represent an integer in base 10 notation: consisting of
                                                an optional plus or minus sign followed by a sequence of digits. The rule will not match if
                                                the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating
                                                point numbers or if only a subsequence of the header value is an integer.

                                                Examples:

                                                * For range [-10,0), route will match for header value -1, but not for 0, "somestring", 10.9,

                                                header value must match the regex. The rule will not match if only a subsequence of the

                                                The rule will match if the request header value is within this range.
                                                The entire request header value must represent an integer in base 10 notation: consisting of
                                                an optional plus or minus sign followed by a sequence of digits. The rule will not match if
                                                the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating
                                                point numbers or if only a subsequence of the header value is an integer.

              RateLimitClientConfig is used to configure the ratelimit rules on routes/destinations.
              All RateLimitPolicy resources in a workspace require an RateLimitClientConfig to in order to function.
              If no RateLimitClientConfig is provided, no ratelimit rules will be enforced.

                                            The rule will match if the request header value is within this range.
                                            The entire request header value must represent an integer in base 10 notation: consisting of
                                            an optional plus or minus sign followed by a sequence of digits. The rule will not match if
                                            the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating
                                            point numbers or if only a subsequence of the header value is an integer.

                                            If specified, this regex string is a regular expression rule which implies the entire request
                                            header value must match the regex. The rule will not match if only a subsequence of the
                                            request header value matches the regex. The regex grammar used in the value field is defined
                                            `(here)[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript]`.

                                            Examples:

                                            * The regex *\d{3}* matches the value *123*
                                            * The regex *\d{3}* does not match the value *1234*
                                            * The regex *\d{3}* does not match the value *123.456*

                                            If specified, header match will be performed based on the suffix of the header value.
                                            Note: empty suffix is not allowed, please use present_match instead.

                                            Examples:

                                            * The suffix *abcd* matches the value *xyzabcd*, but not for *xyzbcd*.

                                            Note: empty prefix is not allowed, please use present_match instead.

                                            Examples:

                                            If specified, header match will be performed based on range.
                                            The rule will match if the request header value is within this range.
                                            The entire request header value must represent an integer in base 10 notation: consisting of
                                            an optional plus or minus sign followed by a sequence of digits. The rule will not match if
                                            the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating
                                            point numbers or if only a subsequence of the header value is an integer.

                                            Examples:

                                            * For range [-10,0), route will match for header value -1, but not for 0, "somestring", 10.9,
