              ExternalService defines a destination for routing which exist outside the mesh.
              This could for example be a web API or a set of virtual machines that are not running in Kubernetes.
              When an ExternalService is defined for a given workspace, it can be used as a
              Destination in Routes, as well as called directly via its specified hostname.
              Resolution of the IP addresses for external services can be done via DNS
              or provided statically using the ExternalEndpoint object.

                  (mutually exclusive with addresses): The List of hostnames which will resolve to this service.
                  These hosts must be unique among all ExternalServices and VirtualHosts within a workspace.
                  Both FQDN and wildcard prefix domains are supported.
                  TLS origination to ExternalServices is supported with use of the ClientsideTls property.

                        If the protocol is HTTPS or TLS, the ExternalService will be configured to use TLS automatically.
                        If used in conjunction with targetPort this can be used for TLS Origination.
                        For example, port: 80, targetPort: 443, with ClientsideTls will cause port 80 traffic from workloads to be forwarded to 443 resulting in HTTPS traffic over the internet with TLS originating at the sidecar proxy.

                  to a failure domain (e.g., country/region/zone). Arbitrary failure
                  domain hierarchies can be represented by separating each
                  encapsulating failure domain by /. For example, the locality of an
                  an endpoint in US, in US-East-1 region, within availability zone
                  az-1, in data center rack r11 can be represented as
                  us/us-east-1/az-1/r11. Istio will configure the sidecar to route to
                  endpoints within the same locality as the sidecar. If none of the
                  endpoints in the locality are available, endpoints parent locality
                  (but within the same network ID) will be chosen. For example, if
                  there are two endpoints in same network (networkID "n1"), say e1
                  with locality us/us-east-1/az-1/r11 and e2 with locality
                  us/us-east-1/az-2/r12, a sidecar from us/us-east-1/az-1/r11 locality
                  will prefer e1 from the same locality over e2 from a different
                  locality. Endpoint e2 could be the IP associated with a gateway
                  (that bridges networks n1 and n2), or the IP associated with a
                  standard service endpoint.

              `RouteTables` defines one or more hosts and a set of traffic route rules to handle traffic for these hosts.
              The traffic route rules can be delegated to other RouteTable based on one or more given hosts or specific paths.

              You may deploy a RouteTable resource in any namespace within your workspace. In order for the RouteTable to be used
              outside of your workspace, you must deploy the RouteTable resource in the root config of your workspace and label it
              with `workspace.solo.io/exported: "true"`. If your RouteTable delegates some traffic rules to another RouteTable,
              the delegated RouteTable may reside in the same workspace or different workspace from your RouteTable. If they are
              in different workspaces, the delegated RouteTable must reside in the root config of their
              workspaces and labelled with `workspace.solo.io/exported: "true"`.

              RouteTable can be used to match traffic originating from a gateway as well as from sidecars within the mesh,
              depends on the configuration of the `virtualGateways` field.

              The following example defines route configuration for the 'uk.bookinfo.com' and 'eu.bookinfo.com' hosts,
              when traffic arriving at the `my-gateway` virtual gateway which is declared in the `my-gateway-ws` workspace.
              When the cookie in the header matches to 'user=dev-123', traffic is forwarded to the port 7777 of the
              `v1` of `reviews.qa`. When the path matches exactly to `/reviews/`, 80% traffic is forwarded to the port 9080
              of `reviews.prod` and 20% traffic is forwarded to the port 9080 of `reviews.qa`. All other traffic is sent
              to the default destination, which is the port 9080 of `reviews.prod` service in the `bookinfo` workspace.

                                          variables defined in `variables` can be used in the jq filter via regular jq variable syntax.
                                          For example, a variable named "userIdHeader" can be used in a jq filter as `$userIdHeader`
                                          Jq filters must only result in one value, or an error will be sent back to the client.
                                          For example, for the input `[1,2,3]`, the jq filter `.[]` is not a valid jq filter as it results
                                          in multiple jq results. However, the jq filter '. | join(",")' is valid as it results in one result: "1,2,3".
                                          Refer to the [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) for jq syntax and tips.
                                          --- Using variables ---
                                          Variables that are declared in the `variables` field are available at the top level of the input JSON object to the
                                          jq filter.
                                          For example, if the following variables have been declared:
                                          ```yaml
                                          variables:
                                            userIdHeader:
                                              request_header: x-user-id
                                            resolverResultVar:
                                              resolver_result: {}
                                          ```
                                          then the input object to the `jq` filter would be
                                          ```json
                                          {
                                           "userIdHeader": <x-user-id header value from GraphQL request>,
                                           "resolverResultVar": { .. the resolver result .. }
                                          }
                                          ```
                                          --- Using a jq filter ---
                                          Given the following input object to the `jq` transformation, we can use a filter to transform the values.
                                          ```json
                                          {
                                           "userIdHeader": "john_doe123",
                                           "resolverResultVar": { "data": {"name": "John Doe"} }
                                          }
                                          ```
                                          If the `jq` filter is defined as
                                          ```
                                          "User: " + .userIdHeader + ", Name: " + .resolverResultVar.data.name
                                          ```
                                          the result of the jq transformation would be
                                          ```
                                          "User john_doe123, Name: John Doe"
                                          ```
                                        type: string
                                      value:

                                          variables:
                                            userIdHeader:
                                              request_header: x-user-id
                                            resolverResultVar:
                                              resolver_result: {}
                                          ```
                                          then the input object to the `jq` filter would be
                                          ```json
                                          {
                                           "userIdHeader": <x-user-id header value from GraphQL request>,
                                           "resolverResultVar": { .. the resolver result .. }
                                          }
                                          ```
                                          --- Using a jq filter ---
                                          Given the following input object to the `jq` transformation, we can use a filter to transform the values.
                                          ```json
                                          {
                                           "userIdHeader": "john_doe123",
                                           "resolverResultVar": { "data": {"name": "John Doe"} }
                                          }
                                          ```
                                          If the `jq` filter is defined as
                                          ```
                                          "User: " + .userIdHeader + ", Name: " + .resolverResultVar.data.name
                                          ```
                                          the result of the jq transformation would be
                                          ```
                                          "User john_doe123, Name: John Doe"
                                          ```

                      The default mode is to use sni routing via tls passthrough at the East/West Gateway to route to services across clusters.
                      In the future, this may change to become smarter (e.g., detect if any pods backing the virtual destination don't have sidecars,
                      if so, then use tls termination so all pods are routeable).

                      This mode is ideal for Gloo Mesh Gateway, i.e. some backing pods don't have sidecars.
                      Since TLS is terminated at the East/West Gateway, the backing service (if it has a sidecar) will not be able to
                      verify the istio mTLS identity of the originating client; rather it will verify the istio mTLS cert of the East/West Gateway.

              `VirtualGateway` represents a logical gateway configuration served by Gateway workloads within
              the same workspace. The specification describes a set of ports that the virtual gateway listens
              for incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections, the type of protocol to use, SNI configuration etc.

              For example, the following VirtualGateway resource configures the gateway to listen for incoming
              HTTP requests on port 80, and delegate the route configuration of the '*.bookinfo.com' hostname
              to be provided by the bookinfo workspace. The VirtualGateway is
              applied to a specific set of gateway pods/VMs with the `app:my-gateway-controller`
              label within the same workspace as the VirtualGateway resource.

              ```yaml
              apiVersion: networking.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: VirtualGateway
              metadata:
                name: my-gateway
                namespace: some-config-namespace
                labels:
                  workspace.solo.io/exported: 'true'
              spec:
                workloads:
                  - selector:
                      labels:
                        app: my-gateway-controller
                listeners:
                  - port:
                      number: 80
                    allowedRouteTables:
                      - host: '*.bookinfo.com'
                        selector:
                          workspace: bookinfo
              ```
              For example, the following VirtualGateway resource configures the gateway to listen for incoming
              HTTP requests on port 80, delegate any `*.foo.com` request to the `HTTPRouteTable` resource(s)
              provided by the `foo-ws` workspace. Further, on the same port 80, it also delegates any
              `*.bar.com` request to the route configurations provided by the `bar-ws` workspace.

              ```yaml
              apiVersion: networking.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: VirtualGateway
              metadata:
                name: my-gateway
                namespace: some-config-namespace
                labels:
                  workspace.solo.io/exported: 'true'
              spec:
                workloads:
                  - selector:
                      labels:
                        app: my-gateway-controller
                listeners:
                  - port:
                      number: 80
                    allowedRouteTables:
                      - host: '*.foo.com'
                        selector:
                          workspace: foo-ws
                      - host: '*.bar.com'
                        selector:
                          workspace: bar-ws
              ```

              For example, the following VirtualGateway resource configures the gateway to act
              as a load balancer listening on port 80 and 9080 (http), 443 (https), and
              9443(https) for ingress.  The VirtualGateway resource is
              applied to a specific set of gateway pods/VMs with the `app: my-gateway-controller`
              label within the same workspace. The route table(s) associated with each
              port 80, 9080 and 443 must be provided by the foo-ws workspace, with hosts that
              match `*.foo.com`. The route table(s) for port 9080 must be provided by the bar-ws
