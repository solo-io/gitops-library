              AccessPolicy is used to define how a destination service is granted. Specifically it describes
              both how clients should be authenticated and authorized to access the service.
              Refer to [this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
              for further details about cross origin resource sharing.
              AccessPolicies are applied at the *Destination Port* level.

                  The details of the JWT policy to apply to the selected routes.

                     Example:
                         Sample JWT Payload: {
                             "org": "solo-io",
                             "iss": "https://localhost",
                             "exp": 4804324736,
                             "iat": 1648651136
                         }

                         Configuration below will enable JWT Authentication for selected routes
                         as well as inject a header into the request containing the value found
                         within the parsed claim if it exists. Empty sources default to extracting
                         JWTs from Authorization Header with prefix "Bearer <Token>"" or Query Param
                         "access_token=<Token>"

                         apiVersion: security.policy.gloo.solo.io/v2

                               <provider_name>:
                                 issuer: "https://localhost"
                                 local:

                                 claimsToHeaders:
                                 - claim: org
                                   header: x-org
                               stage: PRE_AUTHZ

                         This example enables JWT Authentication for selected routes and
                         request will be checked using token found at either X-Auth header with prefix
                         "Bearer <token>" or query param "auth_token=<Token>". Note if a request has both
                         sources available all tokens will need to be valid for the request to be accepted.

                      For example, you might apply multiple policies to your routes to require

                      to allow a failed JWT auth request to pass through to the other authentication
                      method. By default, this value is "false" so that requests that fail JWT
                      authentication then fail authorization immediately.
